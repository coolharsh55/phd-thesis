  abstract = {Legislative compliance assessment tools are commonly used by companies to help them to understand their legal obligations. One of the primary limitations of existing tools is that they tend to consider each regulation in isolation. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular compliance assessment framework that can support multiple legislations. Additionally, we describe our extension of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) so that it can be used not only to represent digital rights but also legislative obligations, and discuss how the proposed model is used to develop a flexible compliance system, where changes to the obligations are automatically reflected in the compliance assessment tool. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through the development of a General Data Protection Regulatory model and compliance assessment tool.},

  abstract = {Privacy policies are known to be impenetrable and lengthy texts that are hardly read and poorly understood. This is why the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces provisions to enhance information transparency including icons as visual means to clarify data practices. However, the research on the creation and evaluation of graphical symbols for the communication of legal concepts, which are generally abstract and unfamiliar to laypeople, is still in its infancy. Moreover, detailed visual representations can support users’ comprehension of the underlying concepts, but at the expense of simplicity and usability. This Chapter describes a methodology for the creation and evaluation of DaPIS, a machine-readable Data Protection Icon Set that was designed following human-centered methods drawn from the emerging discipline of Legal Design. Participatory design methods have ensured that the perspectives of legal experts, designers and other relevant stakeholders are combined in a fruitful dialogue, while user studies have empirically determined strengths and weaknesses of the icon set as communicative means for the legal sphere. Inputs from other disciplines were also fundamental: canonical principles drawn from aesthetics, ergonomics and semiotics were included in the methodology. Moreover, DaPIS is modelled on PrOnto, an ontology of the GDPR, thus offering a comprehensive solution for the Semantic Web. In combination with the description of a privacy policy in the legal standard XML Akoma Ntoso, such an approach makes the icons machine-readable and automatically retrievable. Icons can thus serve as information markers in lengthy privacy statements and support an efficient navigation of the document. In this way, different representations of legal information can be mapped and connected to enhance its comprehensibility: the lawyer-readable, the machine-readable, and the human-readable layers.},

  abstract = {Business processes describe how an organization achieves its goals by defining a set of steps and their orchestration. Such processes have to also comply with different regulations, norms and policies. Compliance management of business processes has received considerable attention. The lion's share goes to checking compliance at process design time. As design-time checking can help eliminate many of the violation scenarios, design-time checking alone is insufficient to guarantee compliance. Thus, attention has shifted to provide compliance support at other phases of a business process lifecycle, especially to that of the enactment phase. However, proposed monitoring approaches have limitations when it comes to the type of compliance requirements supported, the technology used or the assumptions about the process execution environment. In this paper, we discuss the requirements and set the architecture for a proposed approach to provide business process compliance monitoring as a service. In addition, we discuss the different components of the framework and layout an implementation road map.},

Organizations are currently implementing various measures to ensure their software systems fulfill GDPR obligations such as identifying a legal basis for data processing or enforcing data anonymization. However, as regulations are formulated vaguely, it is difficult for practitioners to extract and operationalize legal requirements from the GDPR. This paper aims to help organizations understand the data protection obligations imposed by the GDPR and identify measures to ensure compliance. To achieve this goal, we propose GuideMe, a 6-step systematic approach that supports elicitation of solution requirements that link GDPR data protection obligations with the privacy controls that fulfill these obligations and that should be implemented in an organization's software system. We illustrate and evaluate our approach using an example of a university information system. Our results demonstrate that the solution requirements elicited using our approach are aligned with the recommendations of privacy experts and are expressed correctly.},

We devise such a validation methodology and exemplify it over a knowledge base of articles of the GDPR translated into Reified I/O (RIO) logic and encoded in LegalRuleML. A pivotal element of the methodology is a human-readable intermediate representation of the logic formulæ that preserves the formulæ’s meaning, while rendering it in a readable way to non-experts. After being applied over a use case, we prove that it is possible to retrieve feedback from legal experts about the formal representation of Art. 5.1a and Art. 7.1. What emerges is an agile process to build logic knowledge bases of legal texts, and to support their public trust, which we intend to use for a logic model of the GDPR, called DAPRECO knowledge base.},

Consequently, adequate solutions to ensure that the controller and processor properly understand and meet the data protection requirements are needed. In enterprise reality it is quite common to use Business Process (BP) models to manage the different business activities. Hence the idea of integrating privacy concepts into BP models so as to leverage them to the role of GDPR recommenders. To this end, suggestions and recommendations about data management pursuant to GDPR provisions have been added to specific tasks of the BP, to improve both the process management and personnel learning and training. Feasibility of the proposed idea, implemented into an Eclipse plugin, has been provided through a realistic example.},

The problem is that IT experts may anticipate some unofficial legal meaning, invalid under any interpretation, while verifying if this happens requires legal expertise.

This development in data protection regulations begets the question: how do we audit a computer system’s adherence to a purpose? We propose an approach that identifies a purpose with a business process, and show how formal models of interprocess communication can be used to audit or even derive privacy policies. Based on this insight, we propose a methodology for auditing GDPR compliance. Moreover, we show how given a simple interprocess dataflow model, aspects of GDPR compliance can be determined algorithmically.},

In this paper, we analyze the GDPR text to explicitly identify a set of central challenges for GDPR compliance for which data provenance is applicable; we introduce a data provenance model for representing GDPR workflows; and we present design patterns that demonstrate how data provenance can be used realistically to help in verifying GDPR compliance. We also discuss open questions about what will be practically necessary for a provenance-driven system to be suitable under the GDPR.},

In this context, data protection and user sensitization have to be at the heart of our concerns. This work is part of Personal Information Controller Service (PICS) project. In this paper, we propose a user-centric data protection service to (1) allow users to identify their protection requirements thanks to risks evaluation support tools, (2) provide a “privacy evaluation” of SaaS suppliers based on their ToS and (3) allow users control the access authorizations they grant to SaaS providers. To this end, we define a semi-structured Personal Information System organization used to organize access rights based on a General Data Protection Regulationcompliant ontology.},

Results from the 342 unique studies covered by these reviews demonstrate that eight types of Information Technology artifacts are used in the design, execution and afterexecution lifecycle phases of regulatory compliance to perform compliance modeling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks. The results also demonstrate with statistical evidence that compliance enactment (which involves putting mechanisms in place to address changes in the compliance representations, business processes or regulatory requirements) has received the least attention. This is a worrisome situation given the dynamic environment in which businesses operate. We argue that the findings in this work are relevant toward understanding the current state of the domain, providing insights on what phases and tasks need improvement.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} The use of medical data for research purposes requires an informed consent of the patient that is compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. In the context of multi-centre research initiatives and a multitude of clinical and epidemiological studies scalable and automatable measures for digital consent management are required. Modular form, structure, and contents render a patient’s consent reusable for varying project settings in order to effectively manage and minimise organisational and technical efforts.
Results:\hspace{0.6em} Within the DFG-funded project “MAGIC” (Grant Number HO 1937/5-1) the digital consent management service tool gICS was enhanced to comply with the recommendations published in the TMF data protection guideline for medical research. In addition, a structured exchange format for modular consent templates considering established standards and formats in the area of digital informed consent management was designed. Using the new FHIR standard and the HAPI FHIR library, the first version for an exchange format and necessary import-/export-functionalities were successfully implemented.
Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The proposed exchange format is a “work in progress”. It represents a starting point for current discussions concerning digital consent management. It also attempts to improve interoperability between different approaches within the wider IHE-/HL7-/FHIR community. Independent of the exchange format, providing the possibility to export, modify and import templates for consents and withdrawals to be reused in similar clinical and epidemiological studies is an essential precondition for the sustainable operation of digital consent management.},

The logs should enable verification that data processors abide by the access and usage control policies that have been associated with the data based on the data subject’s consent and the applicable regulations.

The new regulation defines rights for data subjects and obligations for data controllers but it is unclear how subjects and controllers interact concretely. This paper tries to answer two critical questions: is it safe for a data subject to exercise the right of access of her own data? When does a data controller have enough information to authenticate a data subject? To answer these questions, we have analyzed recommendations of Data Protection Authorities and authentication practices implemented in popular websites and third-party tracking services. We observed that some data controllers use unsafe or doubtful procedures to authenticate data subjects. The most common flaw is the use of authentication based on a copy of the subject’s national identity card transmitted over an insecure channel. We define how a data controller should react to a subject’s request to determine the appropriate procedures to identify the subject and her data. We provide compliance guidelines on data access response procedures.},

  abstract = {Since generally legal regulations do not provide clear parameters to determine when their requirements are met, achieving legal compliance is not trivial. The adoption of standards could help create an argument of compliance in favour of the implementing party, provided there is a clear correspondence between the provisions of a specific standard and the regulation’s requirements. However, identifying such correspondences is a complex process which is complicated further by the fact that the established correlations may be overridden in time e.g., because newer court decisions change the interpretation of certain legal provisions. To help solve these problems, we present a framework that supports legal experts in recognizing correlations between provisions in a standard and requirements in a given law. The framework relies on state-of-the-art Natural Language Semantics techniques to process the linguistic terms of the two documents, and maintains a knowledge base of the logic representations of the terms, together with their defeasible correlations, both formal and substantive. An application of the framework is shown by comparing a provision of the European General Data Protection Regulation with the ISO/IEC 27018:2014 standard.},

  abstract = {Cloud services and cloud infrastructures become increasingly complex and dynamic: many different physical and virtual machines, applications and their components interact and all of these entities may be differently reconfigured, deployed, and migrated during run time. In addition, a multitude of stakeholders may be involved in cloud service offering and usage; e.g., service consumers, cloud providers, data subjects, data controllers, and actual end users. Thus, checking whether cloud services comply with data protection policies when storing or processing sensitive data becomes a challenge due to the involved complexity and dynamicity. We present a model-based approach for identifying violations of data protection policies at run-time. Key elements of our approach are (1) a run-time model to represent the actual cloud system and its stakeholders at runtime, and (2) risk patterns that commonly appear in the context of data protection issues. Our approach aims to find instances of these risk patterns in the run-time model. If an instance of a risk pattern is found, this indicates a risk of data protection violation. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by using an industry scenario.},

We establish a mapping between a legal domain ontology, LKIF (Hoekstra et al., 2007), and a Wikipedia-based ontology, YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), and through that we populate LKIF. Moreover, we use the mentions of those entities in Wikipedia text to train a specific Named Entity Recognizer and Classifier. We find that this classifier works well in the Wikipedia, but, as could be expected, performance decreases in a corpus of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. However, this tool will be used as a preprocess for human annotation. We resort to a technique called curriculum learning aimed to overcome problems of overfitting by learning increasingly more complex concepts. However, we find that in this particular setting, the method works best by learning from most specific to most general concepts, not the other way round.},

  abstract = {This report contains preliminary results of the study aiming at automating legal evaluation of privacy policies, under the GDPR, using artificial intelligence (machine learning), in order to empower the civil society representing the interests of consumers. We outline what requirements a GDPR-complaint privacy policy should meet (comprehensive information, clear language, fair processing), as well as what are the ways in which these documents can be unlawful (if required information is insufficient, language unclear, or potentially unfair processing indicated). Further, we analyse the contents of privacy policies of Google, Facebook (and Instagram), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, WhatsApp, Twitter, Uber, AirBnB, Booking.com, Skyscanner, Netflix, Steam and Epic Games. The experiments we conducted on these documents, using various machine learning techniques, lead us to the conclusion that this task can be, to a significant degree, realized by computers, if a sufficiently large data set is created. This, given the amount of privacy policies online, is a task worth investing time and effort. Our study indicates that none of the analysed privacy policies meets the requirements of the GDPR. The evaluated corpus, comprising 3658 sentences (80.398 words) contains 401 sentences (11.0\%) which we marked as containing unclear language, and 1240 sentences (33.9\%) that we marked as potentially unlawful clause, i.e. either a "problematic processing” clause, or an “insufficient information” clause (under articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR). Hence, there is a significant room for improvement on the side of business, as well as for action on the side of consumer organizations and supervisory authorities.},

First, we investigate whether there are differences in cookie setting when accessing Internet services from different jurisdictions. Therefore, we collected cookies from the Alexa Top 100,000 websites and compared their cookie behavior from different vantage points. Second, we assess whether cookie setting behavior has changed over time by comparing today’s results with a data set from 2016. Finally, we discuss challenges caused by these new cookie setting policies for Internet measurement studies and propose ways to overcome them.},

This scenario shows how data processing activities can be managed to in such a way as to support compliance verification.

Many of the requirements of the GDPR are also included in the “ISO27k” family of standards. Consequently, organisations that have applied ISO27k to develop an Information Security Management System (ISMS) are likely to have already accommodated many of the GDPR requirements. This work identifies synergies between the new Regulation and the well-established ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and proposes practices for their exploitation. The proposed alignment framework can be a solid basis for compliance, either for organisations that are already certified with ISO/IEC 27001:2013, or for others that pursue compliance with the Regulation and the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 to manage information security.},

To ensure consumer data protection, rules defined by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) must be adhered to by every organization using Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data for Big Data analysis. Similarly, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) has policy guidelines specifically for organizations handling consumer's payment card data. Both data regulation policies are currently available only in textual format and require significant manual effort to ensure their compliance. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich Knowledge Graph (or Ontology) to represent the rules mandated by both PCI DSS and EU GDPR. In the Ontology, we have also identified the obligations defined in these regulations and related them with corresponding Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) controls. We have validated this Knowledge Graph against the data policies of major vendors that deal with Big Data. This Knowledge Graph that is available in the public domain can be used by Big Data practitioners to automate data protection compliance in their organization.},

  abstract = {Compliance means to ensure that business practice and processes are aligned at commonly accepted norms. Companies are expected to comply with an increasing number of regulations of different origin and complexity. Regulations that are required by law are given the highest priority. Other regulations can be derived from best practice frameworks, company internal standards and inter-company business contracts. Both are necessary to form a company’s compliance policy which meets particular business requirements. Business Process Compliance (BPC) approaches seek to discover methods and techniques to ease the implementation of these compliance regulations. The approaches reveal different process modelling languages and scenarios for mapping relevant compliance rules and the detection of compliance violations. This contribution provides an overview on the state-of- the-art of business process compliance approaches by conducting a literature review. The literature will be analysed and divided into four dimensions. The first dimension includes variables of general business process modelling, such as order, information, location and resource. The second dimension deals with temporal aspects of process modelling. The third dimension differentiates between BPC and verification/validation approaches. The last dimension specifies whether a method or a technical artefact was developed. The findings will be used to visualize the state-of-the-art of BPC.},

  abstract = {The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brings new challenges for companies, who must demonstrate that their systems and business processes comply with usage constraints specified by data subjects. However, due to the lack of standards, tools, and best practices, many organizations struggle to adapt their infrastructure and processes to ensure and demonstrate that all data processing is in compliance with users’ given consent. The SPECIAL EU H2020 project has developed vocabularies that can formally describe data subjects’ given consent as well as methods that use this description to automatically determine whether processing of the data according to a given policy is compliant with the given consent. Whereas this makes it possible to determine whether processing was compliant or not, integration of the approach into existing line of business applications and ex-ante compliance checking remains an open challenge. In this short paper, we demonstrate how the SPECIAL consent and compliance framework can be integrated into Linked Widgets, a mashup platform, in order to support privacy-aware ad-hoc integration of personal data. The resulting environment makes it possible to create data integration and processing workflows out of components that inherently respect usage policies of the data that is being processed and are able to demonstrate compliance. We provide an overview of the necessary meta data and orchestration towards a privacy-aware linked data mashup platform that automatically respects subjects’ given consents. The evaluation results show the potential of our approach for ex-ante usage policy compliance checking within the Linked Widgets Platforms and beyond.},

The difficulties facing organizations are further exasperated by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which introduces stringent requirements for gaining consent, communicating privacy practices, and transparency. Furthermore, consumers' current lack of privacy knowledge can heighten privacy concerns. This study aims to (1) build consumer privacy knowledge and (2) assist organizations in gaining explicit consent and communicating their privacy practices to current and potential customers, through the development of a GDPR privacy label. The paper contributes to practice by providing actionable guidelines for developing GDPR compliant privacy notices and advances privacy literature by extending the privacy knowledge gap model and testing the effectiveness of the GDPR label in improving consumers' privacy knowledge thereby building self-efficacy and enabling informed decision making.},

  abstract = {High returns for processing personal data and low penalties for privacy violations led to the circumstance that protection of privacy was often not considered a priority. To counter this habit and to harmonize data protection laws throughout the European Union, the EU-Commission has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), clarifying data subject rights and ensuring an appropriate level of privacy protection. Through high penalties for non-compliance (i.e. up to 2\% - 4\% of the annual worldwide turnover), GDPR was able to put high pressure on organizations to comply with the requirements. However, studies have shown that organizations are often overwhelmed by the actual requirements.},

Accordingly, privacy has emerged as a key concern for these companies since they need to comply with privacy laws and regulations. To deal with them properly, such privacy concerns should be considered since the early phases of system design. Ontologies have proven to be a key factor for elaborating high-quality requirements models. However, most existing work deals with privacy as a special case of security requirements, thereby missing essential traits of this family of requirements. In this paper, we introduce COPri, a Core Ontology for Privacy requirements engineering that adopts and extends our previous work on privacy requirements engineering ontology that has been mined through a systematic literature review. Additionally, we implement, validate and then evaluate our ontology.},

Additional understanding can be found outside data protection legislation—for instance, in competition law.},

The current state of affairs in data privacy is at a turning point for companies operating in EU state members as the enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) empowers users with control over their personal data, including regulating its disclosure, withdrawing disclosure consent at any given time and tracking their data trail. Compliance with the GDPR is mandatory and it requires signifiant amendments and/or restructuring of data processing routines undertaken by enterprises. Currently, there is no framework to support the GDPR principles.

Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors) which "significantly affect" users. The law will also effectively create a "right to explanation," whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and enable explanation.},

Companies that want to process personal data of the European Union (EU) citizens but are located outside the EU also have to comply with the GDPR. Existing mechanisms for obtaining consent involve presenting the data subject with a document where all possible data processing, done by the entire service, is described in very general terms. Such consent is neither specific nor informed. In order to address this challenge, we introduce a consent request (CoRe) user interface (UI) with maximum control over the data processing and a simplified CoRe UI with reduced control options. Our CoRe UI not only gives users more control over the processing of their personal data but also, according to the usability evaluations reported in the paper, improves their comprehension of consent requests.},

This has been acknowledged by researchers who responded by suggesting metrics to measure different aspects of quality. Tools have also been designed, but determining the set of quality metrics to use may not be a straightforward task. Research on ontology quality shows that detection of problems at an early stage of the ontology development cycle is necessary to reduce costs and maintenance at later stages, which is more difficult to achieve and requires more effort. Assessment using the right metrics is therefore crucial to identify key quality problems. This ensures that the data and instances of the ontology schema are sound and fit for purpose. Our contribution is a systematic survey on quality metrics applicable to ontologies in the Semantic Web, and preliminary investigation towards methods to visualise quality problems in ontologies.},

The way these control mechanisms are implemented can significantly affect individuals’ choices and their privacy outcomes. We present an extensive content analysis of a stratified sample of 150 Englishlanguage websites, assessing the usability and interaction paths of their data deletion options and opt-outs for email communications and targeted advertising. This heuristic evaluation identified substantial issues that likely make exercising these privacy choices on many websites difficult and confusing for US-based consumers. Even though the majority of analyzed websites offered privacy choices, they were located inconsistently across websites. Furthermore, some privacy choices were rendered unusable by missing or unhelpful information, or by links that did not lead to the stated choice. Based on our findings, we provide insights for addressing usability issues in the end-to-end interaction required to effectively exercise privacy choices and controls.},

  abstract = {Privacy in online collection of personal data is currently a much debated topic considering, amongst other reasons, the incidents with well known digital organisations, such as social networks and, in Europe, the recent EU/GDPR regulation. Among other required practices, explicit and simply worded consent from individuals must be obtained before collecting and using personal information. Further, individuals must also be given detailed information about what, how and what for data is collected. Consent is typically obtained at the collection point and, at a single point in time (ignoring updates), associated with Privacy Policies or End-User Agreements. At any moment, both the user and the organization should be able to produce evidence of this consent. This proof should not be disputable which leads us to strong cryptographic properties.The problem we discuss is how to robustly demonstrate such consent was given. We adapt fair-exchange protocols to this particular problem and, upon an exchange of personal data, we are able to produce a cryptographic receipt of acceptance that any party can use to prove consent and elicit non-repudiation. We discuss two broad strategies: a pure peer-to-peer scheme and the use of a Trusted Third Party.},

Systems handling personal data are mandated to track its flow to comply with data protection regulations. We have built a novel framework that integrates semantically rich data privacy knowledge graph with Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology, to develop an automated access-control and audit mechanism that enforces users\&rsquo; data privacy policies while sharing their data with third parties. Our blockchain based data-sharing solution addresses two of the most critical challenges: transaction verification and permissioned data obfuscation. Our solution ensures accountability for data sharing in the cloud by incorporating a secure and efficient system for End-to-End provenance. In this paper, we describe this framework along with the comprehensive semantically rich knowledge graph that we have developed to capture rules embedded in data privacy policy documents. Our framework can be used by organizations to automate compliance of their Cloud datasets.},

  abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive on 25 May 2018. The most significant change is a huge increase in the maximum fine that can be levied for breaches of the regulation. Yet fewer than half of UK companies are fully aware of GDPR—and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped doing so when the Brexit vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become compliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring activities; and carrying out assessments. The paper considers four areas of GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning techniques may be relevant: Following compliance checklists and codes of conduct; Supporting risk assessments; Complying with the new regulations regarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; Complying with the new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state for explanation and justification of reasoning imply that rule-based approaches are likely to be more helpful than machine learning approaches. However, there may be good business reasons to take a different approach in some circumstances.},

This holds also for the legal domain where several ontologies have been put forward to model specific kinds of legal knowledge. Both for standard users and for law scholars, it is often difficult to have an overall view on the existing alternatives, their main features and their interlinking with the other ontologies. To answer this need, in this paper, we address an analysis of the state-of-the-art in legal ontologies and we characterise them along with some distinctive features. This paper aims to guide generic users and law experts in selecting the legal ontology that better fits their needs and in understanding its specificity so that proper extensions to the selected model could be investigated.},

  abstract = {Data processing can be restricted by policies (constraints), to, among others, protect the individual’s privacy, a fundamental human right. Software used to process data may utilize ontologies to represent knowledge as concepts, relationships and restrictions, to solve the task at hand. In knowledge representations, restrictions are typically expressed as axioms, whereas policy-related restrictions have more application specific focus, and are usually expressed as constraints. Thus, various purposes demand differently modeled restrictions. However, existing methodologies do not provide guidelines on how to model restrictions, nor do they distinguish between axioms and constraints. This PhD research aims to investigate the systematic creation of RDF-based restrictions, and their use in policy-compliant data processing. In this paper, I outline my PhD research to (i) analyze the current use of restrictions in ontologies, (ii) provide methodological guidelines to model restrictions, and (iii) apply RDF-based restrictions on data processing to assess policy compliance both before and after the fact. RDF-based restrictions can be modeled by various recommended languages, including OWL, ODRL, SHACL or ShEx. Methodological guidelines to choose the appropriate language or language combinations for an application scenario are beneficial for the knowledge engineering community. Additionally, systematically created restrictions can be used for privacy-compliance assessments.},

  abstract = {Every new privacy regulation brings along the question of whether it results in improving the privacy for the users. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most demanding and comprehensive privacy regulations of all time. Hence, a few months after it went into effect, it is natural to study its impact on the landscape of privacy policies online. In this work, we conduct the first longitudinal, in-depth, and at-scale assessment of privacy policies before and after the GDPR. We gauge the complete consumption cycle of these policies, from the first user impressions until the compliance assessment. We create a diverse corpus of 3,686 English-language privacy policies for which we fetch the pre-GDPR and the post-GDPR versions. Our user study, with 460 participants on Amazon MTurk, does not indicate a significant change in the visual representation of privacy policies from the users' perspective. We also find that the readability of privacy policies suffers under the GDPR, due to almost a 23\% more sentences and words, despite the efforts to reduce the reliance on passive sentences. We further develop a new workflow for the automated assessment of requirements in privacy policies, building on automated natural language processing techniques. Using this workflow, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices, particularly around data retention, user choice, and specific audiences, and that an average of 16.5\% of the policies improved across seven compliance metrics. Finally, we also assess how transparent the organizations are with their privacy practices by performing specificity analysis. In this analysis, we find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the specificity level, averaged over eight metrics, improving in over 19.4\% of the policies.},

The main aim is to investigate whether the GDPR is fit to deal with new technologies such as the IoT.},

  abstract = {Compliance to legal regulations, internal policies, or best practices is becoming a more and more important aspect in business processes management. Compliance requirements are usually formulated in a set of rules that can be checked during or after the execution of the business process, called compliance by detection. If noncompliant behavior is detected, the business process needs to be redesigned. Alternatively, the rules can be already taken into account while modeling the business process to result in a business process that is compliant by design. This technique has the advantage that a subsequent verification of compliance is not required. This paper focuses on compliance by design and employs an artifact-centric approach. In this school of thought, business processes are not described as a sequence of tasks to be performed (i.e., imperatively), but from the point of view of the artifacts that are manipulated during the process (i.e., declaratively). We extend the artifact-centric approach to model compliance rules and show how compliant business processes can be synthesized automatically.},

This enlarges the design space for consent dialogs. Websites could try to maximize click-through rates and consented purposes, even at the risk of users agreeing to more than intended. We evaluate a practice observed on popular websites by conducting an experiment with one control and two treatment groups (N = 150 university students in two countries). We hypothesize that users’ consent decision is influenced by (1) the number of options, connecting to the theory of choice proliferation, and (2) the presence of a highlighted default button (“select all”), connecting to theories of social norms and deception in consumer research. The results show that participants who see a default button accept cookies for more purposes than the control group, while being less able to correctly recall their choice. After being reminded of their choice, they regret it more often and perceive the consent dialog as more deceptive than the control group. Whether users are presented one or three purposes has no significant effect on their decisions and perceptions. We discuss the results and outline policy implications.},

It is made particularly difficult by the complex and dynamic interactions of many entities (hardware and software, as well as organizations and individuals). A model-based approach can be used to reason about these interactions and their impact on data protection during deployment and at run time. The basis for such an approach is a model of all relevant socio-technical cloud entities, which is created during deployment and kept alive at run-time to support adaptations. In this paper, we focus on the meta-model of this model. The meta-model is created during design and instantiated during deployment. We discuss what entities must be present in the meta-model to allow reasoning about data protection. In particular, we discuss to what extent the results of previous cloud modeling efforts can be reused and what extensions are necessary because of the particular requirements of data protection.},

In light of the, now enforced EU-wide, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) we present an automatic technique for mapping privacy policies excerpts to relevant GDPR articles so as to support average users in understanding their usage risks and rights as a data subject. KnIGHT (Know your rIGHTs), is a tool that finds candidate sentences in a privacy policy that are potentially related to specific articles in the GDPR. The approach employs semantic text matching in order to find the most appropriate GDPR paragraph, and to the best of our knowledge is one of the first automatic attempts of its kind applied to a company’s policy. Our evaluation shows that on average between 70–90\% of the tool’s automatic mappings are at least partially correct, meaning that the tool can be used to significantly guide human comprehension. Following this result, in the future we will utilize domain-specific vocabularies to perform a deeper semantic analysis and improve the results further.},

Recently, the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been the centre of tons of debate around the use of profiling and micro-targeting in political elections. We’ve written this analysis to explain what it all means, and the consequences of becoming predictable to companies and political campaigns.

  abstract = {Privacy policies are intended to inform users about the collection and use of their data by websites, mobile apps and other services or appliances they interact with. This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis.},

  abstract = {Legal texts, such as regulations and legislation, are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and system development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal logic, deontic logic, defeasible logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured representations. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, monitor, and test software systems for compliance.},

Risk patterns model fragments of a cloud system that must be avoided because they would lead to high data protection risks. At deployment and at run time, graph pattern matching and dynamic re-configuration methods can be used to ensure that the run-time model of the cloud system contains no instance of the risk patterns.},

Legislative documents provide general norms and specific procedural rules for eGovernment and eCommerce environments, while contracts specify the conditions of services and business rules (e.g. service level agreements for cloud computing), and judgments provide information about the legal argumentation and interpretation of norms to concrete case-law. Such legal knowledge is an important source that should be detected, properly modeled and expressively represented in order to capture all the domain particularities. This paper provides an extension of RuleML called LegalRuleML for fostering the characteristics of legal knowledge and to permit its full usage in legal reasoning and in the business rule domain. LegalRuleML encourages the effective exchange and sharing of such semantic information between legal documents, business rules, and software applications.},

  abstract = {Managing privacy and understanding handling of personal data has turned into a fundamental right, at least within the European Union, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being enforced since May 25th 2018. This has led to tools and services that promise compliance to GDPR in terms of consent management and keeping track of personal data being processed. The information recorded within such tools, as well as that for compliance itself, needs to be interoperable to provide sufficient transparency in its usage. Additionally, interoperability is also necessary towards addressing the right to data portability under GDPR as well as creation of user-configurable and manageable privacy policies. We argue that such interoperability can be enabled through agreement over vocabularies using linked data principles. The W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary and Controls Community Group (DPVCG) was set up to jointly develop such vocabularies towards interoperability in the context of data privacy. This paper presents the resulting Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), along with a discussion on its potential uses, and an invitation for feedback and participation.},

GPDR provides constraints and obligations on the validity of consent, and provides data subjects with the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Determining and demonstrating compliance to these obligations require information on how the consent was obtained, used, and changed over time. Existing work demonstrates feasibility of semantic web technologies in modelling information and determining compliance for GDPR. Although these address consent, they currently do not model all the information associated with it. In this paper, we address this by first presenting our analysis of information associated with consent under the GDPR. We then present GConsent, an OWL2-DL ontology for representation of consent and its associated information such as provenance. The paper presents the methodology used in the creation and validation of the ontology as well as an example use-case demonstrating its applicability. The ontology and this paper can be accessed online at https://w3id.org/GConsent.},

  abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the new European data protection law whose compliance affects organisations in several aspects related to the use of consent and personal data. With emerging research and innovation in data management solutions claiming assistance with various provisions of the GDPR, the task of comparing the degree and scope of such solutions is a challenge without a way to consolidate them. With GDPR as a linked data resource, it is possible to link together information and approaches addressing specific articles and thereby compare them. Organisations can take advantage of this by linking queries and results directly to the relevant text, thereby making it possible to record and measure their solutions for compliance towards specific obligations. GDPR text extensions (GDPRtEXT) uses the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) ontology published by the European Publications Office for exposing the GDPR as linked data. The dataset is published using DCAT and includes an online webpage with HTML id attributes for each article and its subpoints. A SKOS vocabulary is provided that links concepts with the relevant text in GDPR. To demonstrate how related legislations can be linked to highlight changes between them for reusing existing approaches, we provide a mapping from Data Protection Directive (DPD), which was the previous data protection law, to GDPR showing the nature of changes between the two legislations. We also discuss in brief the existing corpora of research that can benefit from the adoption of this resource.},

A privacy policy is a legal document governed by territorial laws that outlines the collection, usage, storage, and sharing of personal data. A known problem with such documents is its ambiguity and difficulty in comprehension for end users. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires transparency regarding the provision of such information to the data subject through its various obligations and rights. We propose a remodelling of the privacy policy based on provision of relevant information regarding personal data specific to the user. Such a policy will dynamically reflect the state of activities over personal data using a legal and comprehensive document, and can be used as a tool for the provision of rights and requests from data subjects. We support our discussion with an example use-case of a GDPR-based privacy policy adopted from online services. We present our analysis on identifying changes and our approach towards the representation and creation of such dynamic policies.},

We make the case that information obtained by auditing the flows of data can assist in demonstrating that the systems handling personal data satisfy regulatory and user requirements. Thus, components handling personal data should be audited to demonstrate that their actions comply with all such policies and requirements. A valuable side-effect of this approach is that such an auditing process will highlight areas where technical enforcement has been incompletely or incorrectly specified. There is a clear role for technical assistance in aligning privacy policy enforcement mechanisms with data protection regulations. The first step necessary in producing technology to accomplish this alignment is to gather evidence of data flows.

  abstract = {The advent of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes organizations to cope with radical changes concerning user data protection paradigms. GDPR, by promoting a Privacy by Design approach, obliges organizations to drastically change their methods regarding user data acquisition, management, processing, as well as data breaches monitoring, notification and preparation of prevention plans. This enforces data subjects (e.g., citizens, customers) rights by enabling them to have more information regarding usage of their data, and to take decisions (e.g., revoking usage permissions). Moreover, organizations are required to trace precisely their activities on user data, enabling authorities to monitor and sanction more easily. Indeed, since GDPR has been introduced, authorities have heavily sanctioned companies found as not GDPR compliant. GDPR is difficult to apply also for its length, complexity, covering many aspects, and not providing details concerning technical and organizational security measures to apply. This calls for tools and methods able to support organizations in achieving GDPR compliance. From the industry and the literature, there are many tools and prototypes fulfilling specific/isolated GDPR aspects, however there is not a comprehensive platform able to support organizations in being compliant regarding all GDPR requirements. In this paper, we propose the design of an architecture for such a platform, able to reuse and integrate peculiarities of those heterogeneous tools, and to support organizations in achieving GDPR compliance. We describe the architecture, designed within the DEFeND EU project, and discuss challenges and preliminary benefits in applying it to the healthcare and energy domains.},

In the context of the discussions, past and present international efforts were examined that focus on data privacy vocabularies and taxonomies as basis work to enable effective enforcement of data handling policies. One example of a current undertaking in this area is the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group (DPVCG) which aims at developing a taxonomy of privacy terms aligned to the GDPR, which encompasses personal data categories, processing purposes, events of disclosures, consent, and processing operations. During the tutorial session, the potential of such efforts was discussed among the participants, allowing for conclusions about the need to re-align and update past research in this area to the General Data Protection Regulation.},

Although business process model and notation (BPMN) is well suited for expressing stakeholder collaboration and business processes support by technical solutions, little is done to depict and analyze the flow of private information and its technical safeguards as it is disclosed to process participants. This gap motivates the development of privacy-enhanced BPMN (PE-BPMN)—a BPMN language for capturing PET-related activities in order to study the flow of private information and ease the communication of privacy concerns and requirements among stakeholders. We demonstrate its feasibility in a mobile app scenario and present techniques to analyze information disclosures identified by models enriched with PE-BPMN.},

Legal-GRL, which is an extension of the Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL), is used for modeling and analyzing legal requirements. However, creating Legal-GRL models is still a manual process, which limits its effectiveness and scalability. In this paper, we propose a new goal modeling framework based on GRL to facilitate the automation of the legal requirements modeling process. Our FOL-based Legal-GRL (FLG) framework uses a legal ontology, which entails a modal theory and First-order Logic (FOL) approach, for the purpose of extraction, refinement, and representation of legal requirements. Our FLG framework consists of a database design and a set of methods for automating the modeling process. We evaluate our work by modeling several statements from HIPAA, PHIPA, the EU GDPR and EU-US Privacy Shield.},

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that has been recently put in force, sets the cornerstones regarding the collection and processing of personal data, for the benefit of Data Subjects and Controllers. However, applying this regulation to the IoT ecosystem is not a trivial task. This paper proposes ADvoCATE, a user-centric solution that allows data subjects to easily control consents regarding access to their personal data in the IoT ecosystem and exercise their rights defined by GDPR. It also assists Data Controllers and Processors to meet GDPR requirements. A blockchain infrastructure ensures the integrity of personal data processing consents, while the quality thereof is evaluated by an intelligence service. Finally, we present some preliminary details of a partial implementation of the proposed framework.},

Compliance to the GDPR is a problem for organizations, it imposes strict constraints whenever they deal with personal data and, in case of infringement, it specifies severe consequences such as legal and monetary penalties. Such organizations frequently are complex systems, where personal data is processed by humans and technical services. Therefore, it becomes fundamental to consider privacy from the social perspective when designing such system, i.e., when relations between different components are specified. This is, indeed, also specified in the GDPR, which encourages to apply privacy-by-design principles. This paper proposes a method to support the design of GDPR compliant systems, based on a socio-technical approach composed of a modeling language and a reasoning framework.},

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years, AI \& Law has provided breakthroughs in studies involving case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, information retrieval and, most recently, conceptual models for knowledge representation and reasoning, known as Legal Ontologies. Ontologies have been widely used by legal practitioners, scholars, and lay people in a variety of situations, such as simulating legal actions, semantic search and indexing, and to keep up-to-date with the continual change of laws and regulations. Given the high number of legal ontologies produced, the need to summarize this research realm through a well-defined methodological procedure is urgent need. This study presents the results of a systematic mapping of the literature, aiming at categorizing legal ontologies along certain dimensions, such as purpose, level of generality, underlying legal theories, among other aspects. The reasons to carry out a systematic mapping are twofold: in addition to explaining the maturation of the area over recent decades, it helps to avoid the old problem of reinventing the wheel. Through organizing and classifying what has already been produced, it is possible to realize that the development of legal ontologies can rise to the level of reusability where prefabricated models might be coupled with new and more complex ontologies for practical law.},

  abstract = {Business process design is primarily driven by process improvement objectives. However, the role of control objectives stemming from regulations and standards is becoming increasingly important for businesses in light of recent events that led to some of the largest scandals in corporate history. As organizations strive to meet compliance agendas, there is an evident need to provide systematic approaches that assist in the understanding of the interplay between (often conflicting) business and control objectives during business process design. In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly present a research agenda in the space of business process compliance, identifying major technical and organizational challenges. We then tackle a part of the overall problem space, which deals with the effective modeling of control objectives and subsequently their propagation onto business process models. Control objective modeling is proposed through a specialized modal logic based on normative systems theory, and the visualization of control objectives on business process models is achieved procedurally. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the context of a purchase-to-pay scenario.},

  abstract = {Compliance with privacy policies imposes requirements on organizations and their information systems. Maintaining auditable privacy logs is one of the key mechanisms employed to ensure compliance, but the logs and their auditing reports are designed and implemented on an application by application basis. This paper develops a Linked Data model and ontologies to facilitate the sharing of logs that support privacy auditing and information accountability among multiple applications and participants. The L2TAP modular ontologies accommodate a variety of privacy scenarios and policies. SCIP is the key module that synthesizes contextual integrity concepts and enables query based solutions that facilitate privacy auditing. Other L2TAP modules describe logs, participants, and log events, all identified by web accessible URIs and include relevant provenance information to support accountability. A health self-management scenario is used to illustrate how privacy preferences, accountability obligations, and access to personal information can be published and accessed as Linked Data by multiple participants, including the internal and external auditors. We contribute query based algorithmic solutions for two fundamental privacy auditing processes that analyse L2TAP logs: obligation derivation and compliance checking. The query based solutions that we develop require SPARQL implementations with limited RDFS reasoning power, and are therefore widely supported by commercial and open source systems. We also provide experimental validation of the scalability of our query based solution for compliance checking over L2TAP logs.},

  abstract = {Demand is growing for more accountability regarding the technological systems that increasingly occupy our world. However, the complexity of many of these systems—often systems-of-systems—poses accountability challenges. A key reason for this is because the details and nature of the information flows that interconnect and drive systems, which often occur across technical and organizational boundaries, tend to be invisible or opaque. This paper argues that data provenance methods show much promise as a technical means for increasing the transparency of these interconnected systems. Specifically, given the concerns regarding ever-increasing levels of automated and algorithmic decision-making, and so-called “algorithmic systems” in general, we propose decision provenance as a concept showing much promise. Decision provenance entails using provenance methods to provide information exposing decision pipelines: chains of inputs to, the nature of, and the flow-on effects from the decisions and actions taken (at design and run-time) throughout systems. This paper introduces the concept of decision provenance, and takes an interdisciplinary (tech-legal) exploration into its potential for assisting accountability in algorithmic systems. We argue that decision provenance can help facilitate oversight, audit, compliance, risk mitigation, and user empowerment, and we also indicate the implementation considerations and areas for research necessary for realizing its vision. More generally, we make the case that considerations of data flow, and systems more broadly, are important to discussions of accountability, and complement the considerable attention already given to algorithmic specifics.},

  abstract = {Data Protection by Design (DPbD) is a truly interdisciplinary effort that involves many stakeholders such as legal experts, requirements engineers, software architects, developers, and system operators. Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection is the result of intensive dialogue and careful trade-off decisions. In practice however, there is a dichotomy between the legal reasoning which is conducted in Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and software engineering approaches, such as threat modeling, aimed at identifying privacy requirements and privacy risks. These activities are commonly performed in total isolation, which negatively impacts (i) the compliance exercise, (ii) the ability to evolve the system over time, and (iii) the architectural trade-offs made during system design. In this article, we present an architectural viewpoint for describing software architectures from a legal, data protection perspective whose core modeling abstractions are based on an in-depth legal analysis of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. This viewpoint is tied to Data Flow Diagrams-commonly used in threat modeling-through correspondence rules. The proposed viewpoint supports the automation of a number of data protection impact assessment steps through (i) meta-model constraints, (ii) model analysis, and (iii) interaction with the involved stakeholders. This enables a streamlined compliance exercise, reconciling legal privacy and data protection notions with architecture-driven software engineering practices. We validate our approach in the context of a realistic e-health application for a number of complementary development scenarios.},

The ontology concepts are extracted from interviews and surveys of compliance management experts and practitioners, and refined through synthesis with leading academic literature related to compliance management. A semiotic framework was utilized to conduct a rigorous evaluation of CoMOn through a series of eight case studies spanning a number of industry sectors. The consensus achieved through the evaluation has positioned CoMOn as a comprehensive domain ontology for Compliance Management.},

  abstract = {Nowadays Internet services have dramatically changed the way people interact with each other and many of our daily activities are supported by those services. Statistical indicators show that more than half of the world's population uses the Internet generating about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data on daily basis. While such a huge amount of data is useful in a number of fields, such as in medical and transportation systems, it also poses unprecedented threats for user's privacy. This is aggravated by the excessive data collection and user profiling activities of service providers. Yet, regulation require service providers to inform users about their data collection and processing practices. The de facto way of informing users about these practices is through the use of privacy policies. Unfortunately, privacy policies suffer from bad readability and other complexities which make them unusable for the intended purpose. To address this issue, we introduce PrivacyGuide, a privacy policy summarization tool inspired by the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and based on machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Our results show that PrivacyGuide is able to classify privacy policy content into eleven privacy aspects with a weighted average accuracy of 74\% and further shed light on the associated risk level with an accuracy of 90\%.},

It proposes the creation of URI identifiers for legislation based on common components and the description of their metadata based on an ontology relying on FRBRoo; the ELI ontology includes in particular the description of the FRBR levels of abstraction, the needed date properties to describe legislation and links to relate legislative acts. Legislation metadata is thus viewed as a global graph of interconnected entities. While ELI tries to lower the entry barrier for legal publishers to disseminate structured metadata and currently counts 13 implementations, it is also facing challenges to progress towards its full potential: data quality, description of ELI datasets, alignment of thematic vocabularies or granular description of the text subdivisions. ELI has the potential to facilitate access to legal information by enabling unambiguous legal citations mark-up, giving legislation more visibility in major web search engines, describing early legislation drafts or facilitating the exchange of data between legal information systems. ELI is tightly connected to novel legal information system architectures, based on legal knowledge graphs; this style of architecture encourages legal publishers to move from a document-centric perspective towards a data-centric perspective, as exemplified by the Casemates in Luxembourg and the Cellar at the Office of Publications of the European Union.},

In this paper, we study and evaluate the effect of the GDPR on the online advertising ecosystem. In a first step, we measure the impact of the legislation on the connections (regarding cookie syncing) between third-parties and show that the general structure how the entities are arranged is not affected by the GDPR. However, we find that the new regulation has a statistically significant impact on the number of connections, which shrinks by around 40\%. Furthermore, we analyze the right to data portability by evaluating the subject access right process of popular companies in this ecosystem and observe differences between the processes implemented by the companies and how they interpret the new legislation. We exercised our right of access under GDPR with 36 companies that had tracked us online. Although 32 companies (89\%) we inquired replied within the period defined by law, only 21 (58\%) finished the process by the deadline set in the GDPR. Our work has implications regarding the implementation of privacy law as well as what online tracking companies should do to be more compliant with the new regulation.},

  abstract = {After the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, more than 60 \% of popular websites in Europe were found to display a cookie consent notice. This has quickly led to users becoming fatigued with privacy notifications and contributed to the rise of both browser extensions that block these banners and demands for a solution that bundles consent across multiple websites or in the browser. In this work, we identify common properties of the graphical user interface of consent notices and conduct three studies with more than 80,000 unique users on a German website to investigate their influence on consent. We find that users are more likely to interact with a notice shown in the lower (left) part of the screen. Given a binary choice, more users are willing to accept tracking compared to mechanisms that require them to allow cookie use for each category or company individually. We also show that the practice of nudging is widely used and has a large effect on the choices users make. Our studies have implications for future regulations and the design of consent notices that encourage users to actively make an informed choice.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of constructing a policy pipeline that enables compliance checking of business processes against regulatory obligations. Towards this end, we propose an Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) profile that can be used to capture the semantics of both business policies in the form of sets of required permissions and regulatory requirements in the form of deontic concepts, and present their translation into Answer Set Programming (via the Institutional Action Language (InstAL)) for compliance checking purposes. The result of the compliance checking is either a positive compliance result or an explanation pertaining to the aspects of the policy that are causing the noncompliance. The pipeline is illustrated using two (key) fragments of the General Data Protect Regulation, namely Articles 6 (Lawfulness of processing) and Articles 46 (Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards) and industrially-relevant use cases that involve the specification of sets of permissions that are needed to execute business processes. The core contributions of this paper are the ODRL profile, which is capable of modelling regulatory obligations and business policies, the exercise of modelling elements of GDPR in this semantic formalism, and the operationalisation of the model to demonstrate its capability to support personal data processing compliance checking, and a basis for explaining why the request is deemed compliant or not.},

  abstract = {Everybody talks about the data economy. Data is collected stored, processed and re-used. In the EU, the GDPR creates a framework with conditions (e.g. consent) for the processing of personal data. But there are also other legal provisions containing requirements and conditions for the processing of data. Even today, most of those are hard-coded into workflows or database schemes, if at all. Data lakes are polluted with unusable data because nobody knows about usage rights or data quality. The approach presented here makes the data lake intelligent. It remembers usage limitations and promises made to the data subject or the contractual partner. Data can be used as risk can be assessed. Such a system easily reacts on new requirements. If processing is recorded back into the data lake, the recording of this information allows to prove compliance. This can be shown to authorities on demand as an audit trail. The concept is best exemplified by the SPECIAL project https://specialprivacy.eu (Scalable Policy-aware Linked Data Architecture For Privacy, Transparency and Compliance). SPECIAL has several use cases, but the basic framework is applicable beyond those cases.},

The ultimate goal of this platform is to empower users by allowing them to have full control on personal data exchange. Moreover, the platform includes specific components to help users to solve cognitive demanding tasks related to the data protection such as how to properly interpret Terms of Service (ToS) imposed by the SaaS, recall previous users interactions with the SaaS (ex. personal data exchanged with the SaaS and the corresponding term of services), and detect unauthorized use of personal data. The technical solution proposed by PICS is a suitable implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We present the motivations, challenges and research questions that lead to the technical solution proposed by PICS.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that there is a gap to be bridged between the development and maintenance of services and the various internal and external policies that emerge and evolve outside of these systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a semantic model, i.e. ontology, for representing Data Flows and linking them with structured representations of the data that is processed (datasets, databases, queries, etc.). Data Flow Diagramming is a technique for capturing the various data and information flows between an information system and external stakeholders as well as within such a system. This technique is used in the analysis phase of information systems development and captures the inputs and outputs of various processes. Our model allows these data flows to be presented and linked with structured representations of the data that is to be used, consulted, processed, etc. We demonstrate that this model can facilitate compliance verification processes of (intelligent) systems by allowing these flows to be analyzed. Next to the ontology, which has been made available according to best practices in the field, we furthermore posit our contributions within the state of the art.},
