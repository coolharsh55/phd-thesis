\chapter{Analysing GDPR Compliance Requirements}
\label{chapter:information}

The analysis of state of the art in \autoref{chapter:sota} provided identification of opportunities for addressing the gaps within it.
These opportunities relate to the research objectives $RO3$ regarding construction of ontologies, $RO4$ for querying, and $RO5$ for information validation.
In order to achieve these, it is imperative to have an understanding of the GDPR and its compliance requirements as required by research objective $RO1$.
The requirement gathering process is shaped by the scope of the research question - which for this thesis is regarding the representation of activities associated with processing of personal data and consent.
The identified requirements then need to be expressed in a form which will facilitate the representation of information as ontologies and its querying and validation in the compliance process. This is required to fulfil research objective $RO2$.

The approaches within the state of the art presents their work in relation to the requirements of GDPR compliance primarily associated with either the data subject or data controller.
In reality, the requirements of compliance are also influenced by the other stakeholders - such as processors and authorities which play an unspecified role in the context of information associated with compliance.
Such roles consist of interactions between stakeholders which involve communication of information such as the instructions provided by a data controller to a processor.
Therefore along with the requirements of compliance, it is also important to understand the interactions between stakeholders, the information involved in such interactions, and the requirements of information in terms of its interoperability between them.
Such analyses and requirements gathering related to the GDPR benefit the larger community and domain by providing the background for standardisation activities in understanding the role of information and its interoperability between stakeholders, such as those for DPVCG \autoref{sec:intro:dpvcg}.

This chapter therefore first presents an analysis of GDPR in terms of stakeholders and interoperability of information between them along with an analysis of suitability of existing standards to represent it in \autoref{sec:info:model}.
Following this, \autoref{sec:info:compliance-questions} frames `compliance questions' that provide information requirements necessary to evaluate compliance, with the methodology presented in \autoref{sec:info:compliance-questions-methodology}, and \autoref{sec:info:constraints} presenting assumptions and constraints that can be used to validate the information for correctness and completeness.
The use of compliance questions as competency questions in the development and evaluation of ontologies is presented in \autoref{chapter:vocabularies}, and the use of constraints for validations is presented in \autoref{chapter:testing}.

\section{Interoperability Model of Information based on GDPR}\label{sec:info:model}

This section presents an analyses of the GDPR in terms of interactions between stakeholders and the information involved in such interactions. It then presents a model of interoperability for information associated with stakeholders. The model enables understanding the role of stakeholders in the compliance process in terms of information requirements and provides a framework to establish the relationship between the interactions and information required for compliance. 
The model also provides motivation to incorporate interoperability as a core requirement within representations of information towards GDPR compliance.
The work described in this section was published within the interoperability and standardisation community as a conference paper
\cite{pandit_gdpr_2018} which was later expanded upon in a journal article \cite{pandit_exploration_2018} and a book chapter \cite{pandit_standardisation_2020}.

The categorisation of stakeholders (or entities) in terms of GDPR compliance are visualised in Figure \ref{fig:info:interoperability-model} and consist of Data Subject (DS), Data Controller (DC), Data Processor (DP) and Supervisory Authority\footnote{Supervisory Authority are also referred to as Data Protection Commission or Regulatory Body} (SA). 
The figure also mentions Data Management (DM) as a type of virtual entity provided by a third party in the form of a product, tool, or service whose function is to provide an interface to the controller or processor for assisting and automating their operations. 
Although the GDPR does not mention or allude to the existence or functionality of DM, it is included based on the information interoperability requirements it represents as required by the operating controller or processor.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{img/interoperability-model.png}
    \caption{Model of information interoperability between entities based on requirements of GDPR \cite{pandit_exploration_2018}}
    \label{fig:info:interoperability-model}
\end{figure}

With this, there are 11 possible points of interactions between entities as indicated by the blue dots in the figure with the label specifying the two entities involved in an interaction.
The interactions are considered directionless, and use the abbreviations defined above. For example, DC-DP represents an interaction between a data controller and a data processor.
The solid line corresponds to interactions defined by the GDPR between stakeholders, while the dotted lines represent interactions derived from information interoperability requirements.
Where a cyclic interaction is specified, such as DC-DC occur between the same type of stakeholder, they represent interactions between different organisations of the same type, which in this case means two different data controllers.

The points of interactions consist of information exchange between entities, are are guided by the requirements of compliance. For example, the interaction between data subject and data controller consists of the data subject providing personal data to the controller, while the controller is required to provide a copy of provided personal data for fulfilment of rights granted by the GDPR.

Analyses of information flows between entities enables categorisation of requirements across the categories of provenance records, consent information, data processing agreements, compliance information, and use of seals/certifications \cite{pandit_exploration_2018}.

\subsubsection{Provenance records}
Provenance in this case refers to information about entities and activities involved in the compliance process, where a record is required to be kept and exchanged for compliance purposes. For example, GDPR requires controllers and processors to maintain provenance records of processing activities carried out under their responsibility in order to maintain and demonstrate compliance to supervisory authorities. Provenance records are also required to be maintained to enable provision of rights to the data subject, and for information sharing between controllers and third parties.

The information stored within provenance records is related to demonstrating compliant processing of personal data and fulfilment of obligations towards demonstration of compliance. They are modelled within the state of the art (see \autoref{chapter:sota}) variously as logs, life-cycles, workflows, activities, and process flows. The term provenance in this case refers to both ex-ante and ex-post phases and is indicative of provenance of information to specify its existence. Therefore provenance in ex-ante phase would mean the record of a model or plan used to indicate future processing of personal data.

Since provenance information as described above encompasses information about artefacts and processes related to compliance, sharing this information in an interoperable format with other entities benefits both in their obligations regarding compliance. For example, controllers  and supervisory authorities sharing interoperable compliance documentation can use the same set of tools and approaches for interacting with the information. Also, by recording the processes associated with compliance as provenance records, the same interoperable methods can be used to maintain, document, and demonstrate the compliance. This is especially useful where information is to be shared between joint controllers and processors that need to exchange plans of processing for agreement as well as logs for successful implementations.

\subsubsection{Data Processing Agreements}
A controller and processor, or controller and another controller, or processor and another processor - are required to have specific data processing agreements in place that specify the processing activities to be carried out. 
In such agreements, the first entity specifies the processing to be carried out, and the second entity is obliged to carry out processing within the scope of received instructions. The GDPR differentiates between a controller and processor based on the freedom to determine the purpose of processing, where a controller can determine such purposes independently while a processor must follow instructions received from a controller.

The provision of instructions from one entity to another need to be recorded by both parties for compliance purposes, and to demonstrate the exact processing operations they are authorised to carry out. GDPR also requires inclusion of information in data processing agreements regarding certain measures such as security safeguards for the processing of personal data. The entity that processes data may also be required to confirm or communicate its fulfilment of instructions under the terms of the agreement, such as when there are obligations for immediate erasure of data following completion of processing operations. Another case is when data is being processed on the basis of consent, the withdrawal of revocation of consent requires such processing to be halted and in some cases the personal data to be erased. When a processor is utilised to process personal data, revocation of consent need to be communicated in order to ensure halting of processing and removal of personal data.

From this, it is evident that data sharing agreements contain information about processing activities, and can be expressed as process flows in both ex-ante and ex-post phases. Here, ex-ante phase refers to the agreement itself where both entities agree on the processing to be carried out, while ex-post information concerns with the completion of processing.

\subsubsection{Consent information}
As per GDPR, consent is an assent or agreement by the data subject regarding the processing of their personal data for specified purposes by one or more entities. 
For compliance, a controller must record information regarding how consent was requested and the choices provided by the data subject in the form of given consent.
GDPR has several obligations and requirements when it comes to valid consent, with additional requirements depending on the sensitivity of personal data and processing. 
Artefacts associated with choices offered for consent therefore need to be preserved to demonstrate the validity of consent obtained using those choices.
Similarly, consent revocation or revisions also need to be similarly stored and linked to the original consent to demonstrate the change was valid as per the requirements of the GDPR.

The processes associated with offering consent choices, retrieving and recording given consent, enabling withdrawal of consent, and executing revocation in internal processes need to thus be documented for compliance by the relevant controller(s).
These are associated across both ex-ante and ex-post phases where consent choices, provision of right to withdrawal, and demonstrating utilisation of consent in processing are demonstrated as ex-ante measures while given consent and revoked consent are ex-post artefacts. 

If consent is considered as an instance of personal data, the same information model used to document processing of personal data can be repurposed to represent activities associated with consent. In addition to this, the activities need to capture the various stages of consent and personal data by representing their life-cycles which involve processes and artefacts which use them or are dependant on them. The 

\subsubsection{Compliance documentation}
Controllers and processors need to maintain ongoing compliance, including documentation of the compliance assessment process. Therefore, compliance as per the GDPR is a continuous process and requires presence of processes or activities that carry out periodic checks of compliance starting from the planning stage to the execution of activities.
When a new service or process is to introduced or an existing process is changed, their compliance is required to be determined and documented prior to their execution.
Such checks may be carried out as part of internal audits or periodic reviews, whose documentation should reflect the outcomes of compliance, and any remedial measures carried out.

The processes associated with compliance involve information about processing activities and can be represented using the same information model as processing activities by including additional information required for the compliance process. Periodic changes or checks can be persisted as provenance records that can act as documentation of compliance processes and the state of compliance at a particular time.

\subsubsection{Use of certifications}
GDPR provides for seals and certifications to be used to denote a certain degree of compliance based on existence of measures and processes indicated by the seal of certification. The presence of such seals and certifications as well as their associated information needs to be exchanged between entities to demonstrate trust and guarantees, such as between processors and controllers, or controllers and data subjects. Seals and certifications indicate a common criteria which is known to entities and supervisory authorities in order to register its use. The exact role of seals and certifications in the compliance process is still under consideration by the authoritative bodies, and is expected to be clarified in the coming period.

\subsubsection{Opportunities for commonality and interoperability}
The model and analyses of information flows between entities provides the motivation for establishing interoperability in the representation of information to be exchanged.
In particular, provenance records regarding activities associated with processing of personal data and consent are relevant in all interactions, and consequently are important to the documentation of compliance for all stakeholders. 

Representing provenance is not limited to representation of processing of personal data, but is also applicable to information about other categories - consent, data processing agreements, compliance, and certifications. Therefore, utilising the same or compatible representation in representing provenance for all categories has advantages of utilising a cohesive management of all associated information towards compliance.

The representation of activities in the ex-ante and ex-post phases associated with processing of personal data is well established based on the analysis of state of the art (see \autoref{sota:analysis:process-flows}). 
Approaches have utilised existing standards such as PROV and BPMN to represent information in an interoperable form. 
While this provides the potential to reuse the same representation towards other information categories described above, the approaches within the SotA do not exploit this opportunity.

As the scope of the thesis focuses on representation of activities associated with processing of personal data and consent, the requirements gathered from this analysis relate primarily to the information associated with provenance of activities and information about consent.
Within this scope, the effort of ensuring potential reuse towards other categories through future extensions is provided by developing an interoperable ontology by using standards that can be utilised to also represent data processing agreements and compliance agreements in the future.
This involves using standards such as RDF and OWL2 to represent the ontology, and the reuse of existing standardised vocabularies such as PROV-O and ELI.
In addition, the research also provides transparency by using terminology of GDPR in the developed ontologies, indicating the requirements used to shape the design of ontology, and indicating the source of concepts within GDPR.

With this motivation, the next parts of this chapter provide the requirements gathered for representing information regarding processing of personal data and consent, while also including other relevant information - such as data breaches and provision of rights - to indicate the potential applicability and reuse of developed ontologies in representing additional information for GDPR compliance.

\section{Compliance Questions}\label{sec:info:compliance-questions}
This section presents `compliance questions' whose answers provide information necessary for evaluating GDPR compliance. The questions are essential to the development of information representations within compliance management systems by providing requirements for the structuring of information and its validation. Within this thesis, they are used to guide the development of ontologies as competency questions (see \autoref{chapter:vocabularies}) and validation of information (see \autoref{chapter:testing}). The questions presented here are by no means exhaustive but represent gathered requirements from authoritative sources. As supervisory authorities and courts continue to clarify and interpret the compliance requirements of GDPR, these questions are expected to change and expand in the future.

\subsection{Methodology}\label{sec:info:compliance-questions-methodology}
The questions were collected from authoritative sources such as data protection commissions, legal experts and agencies - that have published guidelines and resources to assist organisations with the process of establishing and maintaining GDPR compliance.
Some resources - such  as checklists or criteria to self-assess measure of GDPR compliance within an organisation - already provide questions which were adopted for use. In other cases, questions were derived from the reading and understanding of compliance requirements. 

For the questions presented in this thesis, the following sources were used or referenced in addition to the text of GDPR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Guidelines, clarifications, and discussions on the interpretation of GDPR published by European Data Protection Board\footnote{\url{https://edpb.europa.eu/}} (EDPB)
    \item Guidelines, clarifications, and discussions on the interpretation of GDPR published by Article 29 Working Party\footnote{\url{https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/news.cfm?item_type=1360}} and endorsed by EDPB
    \item Resources published Data Protection Commission\footnote{\url{https://dataprotection.ie/}} (Ireland) - with particular focus on document `GDPR guidance for SMEs'\footnote{\url{https://dataprotection.ie/en/guidance-landing/guidance-smes}}
    \item Resources published by Information Commissioners Office\footnote{\url{https://dataprotection.ie/}} (United Kingdom), with particular use of `Data protection self assessment for organisations'\footnote{\url{https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-self-assessment/}}
    \item Resources published by federated data protection offices in Germany, in particular the audit checklist published by Lower Saxony Data Protection Authority\footnote{\url{https://lfd.niedersachsen.de/download/146715/}} which was self-translated from German to English\footnote{\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3380469}}
    \item Resources regarding GDPR compliance published by professional institutions within legal compliance domain, specifically - Nymity\footnote{\url{https://info.nymity.com/gdpr-compliance-toolkit}} and IAPP\footnote{\url{https://iapp.org/resources/article/gdpr-genius/}}
    \item Executive and Court decisions regarding GDPR compliance, tracked using the online community service \url{https://www.enforcementtracker.com/} which also provides the article of GDPR relevant to the decision
\end{itemize}

The collected questions were rephrased and divided into smaller more granular questions towards establishment of information requirements and constraints. 
Each question was assigned an ID to enable tracking its use.
Where possible, each question was associated with specific clauses of the GDPR by denoting the article or recital relevant to it. Each question was analysed in terms of information requirements to identify assumptions that clarify interpretation of the question, and constraints that express a condition that can be tested and used to validate the information. For each identified constraint, a failing test case was identified that did not satisfy the condition and could be used to test its validation.
% \todo{upload all documents to Zenodo and put link here}
% A spreadsheet was used to collect and organise the questions, assumptions, and constraints - and is available as an open resource\footnote{\url{TODO: upload spreadsheet to Zenodo and post link here}}.

The list of questions is presented in \autoref{sec:info:compliance-questions-list} with the assumptions and constraints presented in \autoref{sec:info:constraints}. Along with compliance questions regarding activities associated with processing of personal data and consent, the list also contains questions about additional activities associated with right to be informed and reporting of data breach by controllers. These are later used in the development of ontologies that demonstrate the application of a common approach to represent activities related to processing of personal data, consent, data breach, and provision of rights for GDPR compliance.

\subsection{Assumptions \& Constraints}\label{sec:info:constraints}
An assumption is defined as information or condition that always holds true and is useful in the interpretation of the compliance question. A constraint is defined as a condition that the information pertaining to compliance question must satisfy in order for it to be valid. The assumptions and constraints are listed with reference to the relevant compliance question at the end in brackets.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textit{A.\theenumi}}]
    \item Processing activities as a whole can involve multiple controllers - (CMQ2)
    \item Data recipient categories refer to a collection or abstraction of recipients based on some context such as purpose e.g. “our ad partners” or requirement e.g. “law agencies” - (CMQ8)

\section*{Conclusion}
Through this chapter, an analyses of information associated with GDPR and its compliance was presented. 
% information interoperability model
\autoref{sec:info:model} presented a model of information interoperability between entities as defined by the requirements for GDPR compliance. The model provides an analyses of information requirements and information flows between different entities, and the categorisation of information requirements as provenance records, consent information, compliance documentation, data processing agreements, and use of seals/certifications.
Its analyses also provides a strong motivation towards adopting a common information model for representation of all activities associated with GDPR compliance.

Following this, \autoref{sec:info:compliance-questions} presented `compliance questions' which aim to retrieve information relevant to the evaluation of GDPR compliance. The section also provides the methodology used to formulate the questions from authoritative sources. The compliance questions are accompanied with identification of assumptions and constraints which are useful towards the establishment of information requirements and its validation.
