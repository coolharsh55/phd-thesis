With the information identified using the compliance questions, assumptions, and constraints in \autoref{sec:info:compliance-questions}, competency questions were established to identify necessary concepts and relationships to create ontological representations using established procedures \cite{noy,neon}.
The competency questions presented in the following sections areare based on the three objectives as outlined within $RO3$ in \autoref{sec:intro:RO}.  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item concepts and text of the GDPR: representation of concepts within GDPR and associated with its compliance, representation of links between information and specific clauses of GDPR
    \item activities associated with personal data: representation of activities associated with processing of personal data in both ex-ante and ex-post phases
    \item information associated with consent: representation of information necessary to evaluate compliance of consent in its various states (given or otherwise)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Competency Questions for GDPR concepts and representation}
These competency questions are concerned with the representation of concepts within GDPR and its compliance, and association of information with specific clauses of the GDPR.
