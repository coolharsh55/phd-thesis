\chapter{State of the Art}\label{chapter:sota}
This chapter presents the state of the art (SotA) regarding approaches for GDPR compliance.
The first section (\autoref{sec:sota:models}) presents an overview of technological approaches for legal compliance to date.
The second section (\autoref{sec:sota:gdpr-semweb}) presents an overview of approaches for GDPR compliance utilising semantic web, with the third section (\autoref{sec:sota:gdpr-other}) presenting other approaches for GDPR compliance,
while the fourth section (\autoref{sec:sota:other}) presents approaches regarding regulatory compliance which do not directly concern the GDPR but are relevant towards understanding the SotA.
The chapter concludes (\autoref{sec:sota:analysis}) with an analysis of presented approaches and a discussion on the identified gaps for further work in the domain of utilising semantic web for GDPR compliance.

\section{Overview of Technological Approaches for Legal Compliance}\label{sec:sota:models}
This section provides an overview of technological approaches utilised for addressing legal compliance. It presents the different methodologies and frameworks for interpreting requirements from legal documents, and using technological frameworks towards the management of information and compliance.
To that end, the section utilises surveys and key publications in the last decade (2007-2019) to identify the state of the art.

\begin{itemize}
\item Access control and the Resource Description Framework: A survey
	\begin{itemize}
	\item access \$ trust policies - refers to actions like authentication, authorization and security preservation. Access policies define permissions, restrictions or prohibitions associated with an asset for making this asset available to a user in a specific role or other related feature of distinction (Kirrane et al. 2015). 
	\item license policies -  license is used to express generalized terms about the intended usage pattern of a certain asset and usually defines the notion of property associated with a specific asset (such as declaring the degree of permissiveness allowed in the reuse of a certain asset). 
	\item policy representation - entities, roles, resources, concepts
	\end{itemize}
\item Addressing Legal Requirements in Requirements Engineering
	\begin{itemize}
	\item symbolic logic / mathematical logic
		\begin{itemize}
		\item balance logic with natural language
		\end{itemize}
	\item knowledge representation - represent legal text as computer programs or algorithms
	\item deontic logic - rights and obligations
	\item defeasible logic - strict rules, defeasible rules, and defeaters
	\item first order temporal logic - extract key concepts rather than precisely modelling the regulation
	\item access control - access control techniques to capture the privacy-related elements of legal texts, conditions and obligations that cannot be 9 represented as access control rules are cast instead as external environmental flags
	\item markup-based representations
	\item goal based modeling - extracting and representing goals, soft goals, tasks, resources, and social relationships
	\item reusable requirements catalog - applying requirements engineering to create reusable catalog of legal requirements
	\end{itemize}
\item A genealogy and classification of rights expression languages-preliminary results - REL
	\begin{itemize}
	\item contract policies -  contract is a legally binding agreement of two or more parties, on the exchange of rights to (digital) goods or services under certain terms and conditions Guth (2004, p. 81)
	\item enforcement framework - environment in which the access control is enforced
	\item enforcement mechanism - logic based (DL), rules, semantic web (RDFS, SPARQL)
	\end{itemize}
\item Formalizing and appling compliance patterns for business process compliance - survey of applying compliance patterns to business process compliancec
	\begin{itemize}
	\item temporal logic
		\begin{itemize}
		\item bottom-up - use logical language to represent compliance requirements, and to transform process specifications to formal representations, then verify for compliance
		\item top-down - processes are represented using high-level abstract langauges, compliance requirments are formalised using temporal logic language, then verified for compliance
		\end{itemize}
	\item deontic logic 
	\item graph pattern matching approaches - pattern specification and matching with querying of business process artefacts
